# lottery
This is the starter project, which covers the most important topic of mern, and I made it to learn and practice.
This is a basic Mern project. I made this project while learning Node and Express JS. This is not a real-life applicable or ready-to-deploy web app since I have not done any research or made a better UI, which may be a lot different than the actual lottery system.
In this project, I have covered the following topics: React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

 (1) How to use react hooks like useState and useEffect. 
 (2) Utilizing React Roter.
 (3) Using express.js, backend validation, error handling, and module. exports, etc.
 (4) HTTP methods like get and put request, query, and params.
 (5) Using MongoDB and basic Mongoose queries to edit, create, and find.
 (6) Getting data from the database in the front end.
 (7) Save the database from the frontend in the database.
