# lottery
This is the starter project, which covers the most important topic of mern, and I made it to learn and practice.
This is a basic Mern project. I made this project while learning Node and Express JS. This is not a real-life applicable or ready-to-deploy web app since I have not done any research or made a better UI, which may be a lot different than the actual lottery system.
In this project, I have covered the following topics: <h3> React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB <h3>
 <br/>
 (1) How to use react hooks like useState and useEffect.  <br/>
 (2) Utilizing React Roter. <br/>
 (3) Using express.js, backend validation, error handling, and module. exports, etc. <br/>
 (4) HTTP methods like get and put request, query, and params. <br/>
 (5) Using MongoDB and basic Mongoose queries to edit, create, and find. <br/>
 (6) Getting data from the database in the front end. <br/>
 (7) Save the database from the frontend in the database.   <br/>
